# Overview

Solid Router is the universal routing library for SolidJS, inspired by [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and [Ember Router](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/routing/).
This library is designed to work in both client and server environments, and it supports all of Solid's SSR methods.
Additionally, it contains Solid's transitions so it can be used freely with suspense, resources, and lazy components. 

A router is a powerful tool allows you to change the view of your application based on the URL in the browser.
This makes a single page application feel more like a traditional multipage site.
By defining components called Routes that depend on the value of the URL (the "path"), the router will handle swapping them in and out as needed when a user navigates through your application.

Solid router contains a number of features that make it a powerful tool for building applications, including:
- [**Nested Routing**](/solid-router/advanced-concepts/nested-routes): Define routes that are nested within other routes, so that navigation can change a part of a component rather than completely replacing it.
- [**Route Matching**](/solid-router/advanced-concepts/dynamic-routes): Based on the URL, you can match routes and pass parameters to the matched component.
- [**Actions**](/solid-router/advanced-concepts/actions): When you define a route, you can also define actions that are triggered when the route is matched. 
This allows you to perform side effects or other logic.
- [**Load Function**](/solid-router/advanced-concepts/render-as-you-fetch): Define a load function that loads parallel to the routes.
