There are two ways to define routes in Solid Router:
- [Component Routing](#component-routing): Define routes using JSX
- [Configuration-based Routing](#configuration-based-routing): Define routes using an array of route definitions


## Component routing

Component routing is the most common way to define routes in Solid Router.
It allows for the use of JSX to define routes and the components to render when the user navigates to that path.

Each route is added to the `Router` component using [`Route`](/solid-router/reference/components/route).
The `Route` component takes a `path` prop, which is the path to match, and a `component` prop, which is the component to render when the path matches:

<TabsCodeBlocks>
<div id="src/app.jsx">
```jsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router, Route } from "@solidjs/router";

import Home from "./pages/Home";
import Users from "./pages/Users";

render(
	() => (
		<Router>
			<Route path="/" component={Home} />
			<Route path="/users" component={Users} />
		</Router>
	),
	document.getElementById("app")
);
```
</div>
<div id="src/pages/Home.jsx">
```jsx
export const Home = () => <div>Home Page</div>;
```
</div>

<div id="src/pages/Users.jsx">
```jsx
export const Users = () => <div>Users Page</div>;
```
</div>
</TabsCodeBlocks>


Once the `Router` component is set up with the desired routes, the `Route` components will render the specified components when the user navigates to the corresponding paths.
For example, when the user navigates to `/users`, the `Users` component will be rendered:

```powershell title="http://localhost:3000/1/2"
Users Page
```

## Configuration-based routing

JSX is not required to define routes in Solid Router.
If you prefer, you can define routes using an array of route definitions and pass them to the `Router` component:

```jsx
import { lazy } from "solid-js";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";

const routes = [
	{
		path: "/",
		component: import("./pages/Home"),
	},
	{
		path: "/users",
		component: import("./pages/Users"),
	},
];

render(() => <Router>{routes}</Router>, document.getElementById("app"));
```

Additionally, a single route definition object for a single route can be passed:

```jsx
import { lazy } from "solid-js";
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";

const route = {
	path: "/",
	component: import("/pages/index.js"),
};

render(() => <Router>{route}</Router>, document.getElementById("app"));
```

## CatchAll Route (404 page)

When a user navigates to a path that does not match any of the defined routes, a catchall, or 404 page, can be provided as a fallback option to display to the user.
This is done by adding a `Route` component with a `path` prop of `*`:

<TabsCodeBlocks>

<div id="src/app.jsx">
```jsx title="src/app.jsx"
<Router root={App}>
	<Route path="/users" component={Users} />
	<Route path="/" component={Home} />
	<Route path="*" component={NotFound} />
</Router>
```
</div>

<div id="src/pages/Notfound.jsx">
```jsx title="src/pages/Notfound.jsx"
export const NotFound = () => <div>404 Page Not Found</div>;
```
</div>

</TabsCodeBlocks>

In the example above, the `NotFound` component will be rendered when the user navigates to a path that does not match any of the defined routes.
Optionally, you can specify a parameter name to access the remaining portion of the path:

```jsx
<Route path="/*404" component={NotFound} />
```

If the user were to navigate to `/some/unknown/path`, the `NotFound` component would be rendered:

```powershell title="http://localhost:3000/some/unknown/path"
404 Page Not Found
```

## Lazy-loading routes

To improve the performance of your application, you can use the `lazy` function from Solid to load components only when they are needed.
This is especially useful for large components that are not needed immediately when the application loads:

```jsx
const ComplexPage = lazy(() => import("./pages/ComplexPage"));
```

The `lazy` function takes a function that returns a promise that resolves to the component.
When the component is needed, the promise will be resolved and the component will be loaded.
When using configuration-based routing, you can use the `lazy` function to load components lazily, to improve the performance of your application:

```jsx
const routes = [
	{
		path: "/",
		component: lazy(() => import("./pages/Home")),
	},
	{
		path: "/users",
		component: lazy(() => import("./pages/Users")),
	},
];
```
