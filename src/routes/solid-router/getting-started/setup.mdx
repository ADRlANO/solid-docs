title: Installation & Setup
---

Solid Router is not included in Solid by default.
To use it, you must install it separately using your package manager of choice:

<TabsCodeBlocks>
<div id="npm">
```bash frame="none"
npm i @solidjs/router
```
</div>

<div id="yarn">
```bash frame="none"
yarn add @solidjs/router
```
</div>

<div id="pnpm">
```bash frame="none"
pnpm add @solidjs/router
```
</div>

</TabsCodeBlocks>


<Callout title="Requirements">
The latest version of Solid Router is `0.10.x`.
To use this version, Solid v1.8.4 or later is required.
</Callout>

## Configuration

To use Solid Router, you need to wrap your application with the [`Router`](/solid-router/reference/components/router) component.
This component is the root of your routing configuration and is responsible for rendering the correct component based on the current URL.

To configure your routes, import the `Router` component and then start the application by rendering the router component:

```jsx title="againstpp.tsx"
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { Router } from "@solidjs/router";

render(
  () => <Router />,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

This will render the router component and start listening to URL changes.
You are now ready to start [defining your routes](/solid-router/getting-started/defining-routes/)!
